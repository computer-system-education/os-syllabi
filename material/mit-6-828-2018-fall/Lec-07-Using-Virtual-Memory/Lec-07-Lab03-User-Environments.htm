<h1>Lab 3: User Environments</h1>

<p>
<b>
Part A due Thursday, October 4, 2018 <br>
Part B due Thursday, October 11, 2018
</b>
</p>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>
In this lab you will implement the basic kernel facilities
required to get a protected user-mode environment (i.e., "process") running.
You will enhance the JOS kernel
to set up the data structures to keep track of user environments,
create a single user environment,
load a program image into it,
and start it running.
You will also make the JOS kernel capable
of handling any system calls the user environment makes
and handling any other exceptions it causes.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b>
In this lab, the terms <i>environment</i> and <i>process</i> are
interchangeable - both refer to an abstraction that allows you to run a program.  We introduce the
term "environment" instead of the traditional term "process"
in order to stress the point that JOS environments and UNIX processes
provide different interfaces, and do not provide
the same semantics.

<p>
In addition, a number of the source files we handed out for lab2
are modified in lab3.
To see the differences, you can type:
</p>

<pre>$ <kbd>git diff lab2</kbd>
</pre>

<p>
You may also want to take another look at the <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/labguide.html">lab tools guide</a>, as it includes
information on debugging user code that becomes relevant in this lab.
</p>

<h3 id="Lab-Requirements">Lab Requirements</h3>

<p>
This lab is divided into two parts, A and B.
Part A is due a week after this lab was assigned;
you should commit your changes and <kbd>make handin</kbd>
 your lab before the Part A deadline,
making sure your code passes all of the Part A tests (it is okay
if your code does not pass the Part B tests yet).
You only need to have the Part B tests passing
by the Part B deadline at the end of the second week.
</p>

<p>
As in lab 2,
you will need to do all of the regular exercises described in the lab
and <i>at least one</i> challenge problem (for the entire lab, not for
each part).
Write up brief answers
to the questions posed in the lab
and a one or two paragraph description of what you did
to solve your chosen challenge problem
in a file called <tt>answers-lab3.txt</tt>
in the top level of your <tt>lab</tt> directory.
(If you implement more than one challenge problem,
you only need to describe one of them in the write-up.)
Do not forget to include the answer file in your submission with
<kbd>git add answers-lab3.txt</kbd>.
</p>

<!--
<p>
Passing all the <kbd>make grade</kbd> tests
does not mean your code is perfect.  It may have subtle bugs that will
only be tickled by future labs.
In particular, all your kernel code is running in the same address
space with no protection.  If you get weird crashes
that don't seem to be explainable by a bug in the crashing code,
it's likely that they're due to a bug somewhere else that is
modifying memory used by the crashing code.
GDB watchpoints are often a good way to debug such problems.
</p>
-->

<h3 id="Inline-Assembly">Inline Assembly</h3>

<p>
In this lab you may find GCC's inline assembly language feature useful,
although it is also possible to complete the lab without using it.
At the very least, you will need to be able to understand
the fragments of inline assembly language ("<tt>asm</tt>" statements)
that already exist in the source code we gave you.
You can find several sources of information
on GCC inline assembly language
on the class <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/reference.html">reference materials</a> page.
</p>


<h2 id="Part-A--User-Environments-and-Exception-Handling">Part A: User Environments and Exception Handling</h2>

<p>
The new include file <tt>inc/env.h</tt>
contains basic definitions for user environments in JOS.
Read it now.
The kernel uses the <code>Env</code> data structure
to keep track of each user environment.
In this lab you will initially create just one environment,
but you will need to design the JOS kernel
to support multiple environments;
lab 4 will take advantage of this feature
by allowing a user environment to <code>fork</code> other environments.
</p>

<p>
As you can see in <tt>kern/env.c</tt>,
the kernel maintains three main global variables
pertaining to environments:
</p>

<pre>struct Env *envs = NULL;		// All environments
struct Env *curenv = NULL;		// The current env
static struct Env *env_free_list;	// Free environment list
</pre>

<p>
Once JOS gets up and running,
the <code>envs</code> pointer points to an array of <code>Env</code> structures
representing all the environments in the system.
In our design,
the JOS kernel will support a maximum of <code>NENV</code>
simultaneously active environments,
although there will typically be far fewer running environments
at any given time.
(<code>NENV</code> is a constant <code>#define</code>'d in <tt>inc/env.h</tt>.)
Once it is allocated,
the <code>envs</code> array will contain
a single instance of the <code>Env</code> data structure
for each of the <code>NENV</code> possible environments.
</p>

<p>
The JOS kernel keeps all of the inactive <code>Env</code> structures
on the <code>env_free_list</code>.
This design allows easy allocation and
deallocation of environments,
as they merely have to be added to or removed from the free list.
</p>

<p>
The kernel uses the <code>curenv</code> symbol
to keep track of the <i>currently executing</i> environment at any given time.
During boot up, before the first environment is run,
<code>curenv</code> is initially set to <code>NULL</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="Environment-State">Environment State</h3>

<p>
The <code>Env</code> structure
is defined in <tt>inc/env.h</tt> as follows
(although more fields will be added in future labs):
</p>

<pre>struct Env {
	struct Trapframe env_tf;	// Saved registers
	struct Env *env_link;		// Next free Env
	envid_t env_id;			// Unique environment identifier
	envid_t env_parent_id;		// env_id of this env's parent
	enum EnvType env_type;		// Indicates special system environments
	unsigned env_status;		// Status of the environment
	uint32_t env_runs;		// Number of times environment has run

	// Address space
	pde_t *env_pgdir;		// Kernel virtual address of page dir
};
</pre>

<p>
Here's what the <code>Env</code> fields are for:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>env_tf</b>:</dt>
<dd>	This structure, defined in <tt>inc/trap.h</tt>,
	holds the saved register values for the environment
	while that environment is <i>not</i> running:
	i.e., when the kernel or a different environment is running.
	The kernel saves these when
	switching from user to kernel mode,
	so that the environment can later be resumed where it left off.</dd>

<dt><b>env_link</b>:</dt>
<dd>	This is a link to the next <code>Env</code> on the
	<code>env_free_list</code>.  <code>env_free_list</code> points
	to the first free environment on the list.</dd>

<dt><b>env_id</b>:</dt>
<dd>	The kernel stores here a value
	that uniquely identifiers
	the environment currently using this <code>Env</code> structure
	(i.e., using this particular slot in the <code>envs</code> array).
	After a user environment terminates,
	the kernel may re-allocate
	the same <code>Env</code> structure to a different environment -
	but the new environment
	will have a different <code>env_id</code> from the old one
	even though the new environment
	is re-using the same slot in the <code>envs</code> array.</dd>

<dt><b>env_parent_id</b>:</dt>
<dd>	The kernel stores here the <code>env_id</code>
	of the environment that created this environment.
	In this way the environments can form a “family tree,”
	which will be useful for making security decisions
	about which environments are allowed to do what to whom.</dd>

<dt><b>env_type</b>:</dt>
<dd>	This is used to distinguish special environments.  For most
	environments, it will be <code>ENV_TYPE_USER</code>.  We'll introduce
	a few more types for special system service environments in later labs.
</dd>

<dt><b>env_status</b>:</dt>
<dd>	This variable holds one of the following values:
	<dl>
	<dt><code>ENV_FREE</code>:</dt>
	<dd>	Indicates that the <code>Env</code> structure is inactive,
		and therefore on the <code>env_free_list</code>.</dd>
	<dt><code>ENV_RUNNABLE</code>:</dt>
	<dd>	Indicates that the <code>Env</code> structure
		represents an environment that is waiting to run on the
		processor.</dd>
	<dt><code>ENV_RUNNING</code>:</dt>
	<dd>	Indicates that the <code>Env</code> structure
		represents the currently running environment.</dd>
	<dt><code>ENV_NOT_RUNNABLE</code>:</dt>
	<dd>	Indicates that the <code>Env</code> structure
		represents a currently active environment,
		but it is not currently ready to run:
		for example, because it is waiting
		for an interprocess communication (IPC)
		from another environment.</dd>
	<dt><code>ENV_DYING</code>:</dt>
	<dd>	Indicates that the <code>Env</code> structure
		represents a zombie environment. A zombie environment will be
		freed the next time it traps to the kernel. We will not use
		this flag until Lab 4.</dd>
	</dl></dd>

<dt><b>env_pgdir</b>:</dt>
<dd>	This variable holds the kernel <i>virtual address</i> 
	of this environment's page directory.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Like a Unix process, a JOS environment couples the concepts of
"thread" and "address space".  The thread is defined primarily by the
saved registers (the <code>env_tf</code> field), and the address space
is defined by the page directory and page tables pointed to by
<code>env_pgdir</code>.  To run an
environment, the kernel must set up the CPU with <i>both</i> the saved
registers and the appropriate address space.
</p>

<p>
Our <code>struct Env</code> is analogous to <code>struct proc</code>
in xv6.  Both structures hold the environment's (i.e., process's)
user-mode register state in a <code>Trapframe</code>
structure.  In JOS,
individual environments do not have their own kernel stacks as
processes do in xv6.  There can be only one JOS environment active in
the kernel at a time, so JOS needs only a
<i>single</i> kernel stack.
</p>

<h3 id="Allocating-the-Environments-Array">Allocating the Environments Array</h3>

<p>
In lab 2,
you allocated memory in <code>mem_init()</code>
for the <code>pages[]</code> array,
which is a table the kernel uses to keep track of
which pages are free and which are not.
You will now need to modify <code>mem_init()</code> further
to allocate a similar array of <code>Env</code> structures,
called <code>envs</code>.
</p>

<div class="required"><div id="Exercise-1" style="position: relative; top: -5em;"></div>
<p><span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
	Modify <code>mem_init()</code> in <tt>kern/pmap.c</tt>
	to allocate and map the <code>envs</code> array.
	This array consists of
	exactly <code>NENV</code> instances of the <code>Env</code>
	structure allocated much like how you allocated the
	<code>pages</code> array.
	Also like the <code>pages</code> array, the memory backing
	<code>envs</code> should also be mapped user read-only at
	<code>UENVS</code> (defined in <tt>inc/memlayout.h</tt>) so
	user processes can read from this array.
	</p>
	<p>
	You should run your code and make sure
	<code>check_kern_pgdir()</code> succeeds.
</p></div>


<h3 id="Creating-and-Running-Environments">Creating and Running Environments</h3>

<p>
You will now write the code in <tt>kern/env.c</tt> necessary to run a
user environment.  Because we do not yet have a filesystem, we will
set up the kernel to load a static binary image that is <i>embedded
within the kernel itself</i>. JOS embeds
this binary in the kernel as a ELF executable image.
</p>

<p>
The Lab 3 <tt>GNUmakefile</tt> generates a number of binary images in
the <tt>obj/user/</tt> directory.  If you look at
<tt>kern/Makefrag</tt>, you will notice some magic that "links" these
binaries directly into the kernel executable as if they were
<tt>.o</tt> files.  The <tt>-b binary</tt> option on the linker
command line causes these files to be linked in as "raw" uninterpreted
binary files rather than as regular <tt>.o</tt> files produced by the
compiler.  (As far as the linker is concerned, these files do not have
to be ELF images at all - they could be anything, such as text files
or pictures!)  If you look at <tt>obj/kern/kernel.sym</tt> after
building the kernel, you will notice that the linker has "magically"
produced a number of funny symbols with obscure names like
<tt>_binary_obj_user_hello_start</tt>,
<tt>_binary_obj_user_hello_end</tt>, and
<tt>_binary_obj_user_hello_size</tt>.  The linker generates these
symbol names by mangling the file names of the binary files; the
symbols provide the regular kernel code with a way to reference the
embedded binary files.
</p>

<p>
In <code>i386_init()</code> in <tt>kern/init.c</tt> you'll see code to run
one of these binary images in an environment.  However, the critical
functions to set up user environments are not complete; you will need
to fill them in.
</p>

<div class="required"><div id="Exercise-2" style="position: relative; top: -5em;"></div>
<p><span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
	In the file <tt>env.c</tt>,
	finish coding the following functions:
	</p>
	<dl>
	<dt>	<code>env_init()</code></dt>
	<dd>	Initialize all of the <code>Env</code> structures
		in the <code>envs</code> array and
		add them to the <code>env_free_list</code>.
		Also calls <code>env_init_percpu</code>, which
		configures the segmentation hardware with
		separate segments for privilege level 0 (kernel) and
		privilege level 3 (user).</dd>
	<dt>	<code>env_setup_vm()</code></dt>
	<dd>	Allocate a page directory for a new environment
		and initialize the kernel portion
		of the new environment's address space.</dd>
	<dt>	<code>region_alloc()</code></dt>
	<dd>	Allocates and maps physical memory for an environment</dd>
	<dt>	<code>load_icode()</code></dt>
	<dd>	You will need to parse an ELF binary image,
		much like the boot loader already does,
		and load its contents into the user address space
		of a new environment.</dd>
	<dt>	<code>env_create()</code></dt>
	<dd>	Allocate an environment with <code>env_alloc</code>
		and call <code>load_icode</code> to load an ELF binary into it.</dd>
	<dt>	<code>env_run()</code></dt>
	<dd>	Start a given environment running in user mode.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>
	As you write these functions,
	you might find the new cprintf verb <code>%e</code>
	useful -- it prints a description corresponding to an error code.
	For example,
        </p>
	<pre>	r = -E_NO_MEM;
	panic("env_alloc: %e", r);</pre>
        <p>
	will panic with the message "env_alloc: out of memory".
        </p>

<p>
Once you are done you should compile your kernel and run it under QEMU.
If all goes well, your system should enter user space and execute the
<tt>hello</tt> binary until it makes a system call with the
<code>int</code> instruction.  At that point there will be trouble, since
JOS has not set up the hardware to allow any kind of transition
from user space into the kernel.
When the CPU discovers that it is not set up to handle this system
call interrupt, it will generate a general protection exception, find
that it can't handle that, generate a double fault exception, find
that it can't handle that either, and finally give up with what's
known as a "triple fault".  Usually, you would then see the CPU reset
and the system reboot.  While this is important for legacy
applications (see <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2005/02/08/369243.aspx">
this blog post</a> for an explanation of why), it's a pain for kernel
development, so with the 6.828 patched QEMU you'll instead see a
register dump and a "Triple fault." message.
</p>

<p>
We'll address this problem shortly, but for now we can use the
debugger to check that we're entering user mode.  Use <kbd>make
qemu-gdb</kbd> and set a GDB breakpoint at <code>env_pop_tf</code>,
which should be the last function you hit before actually entering user mode.
Single step through this function using <kbd>si</kbd>;
the processor should enter user mode after the <code>iret</code> instruction.
You should then see the first instruction
in the user environment's executable,
which is the <code>cmpl</code> instruction at the label <code>start</code>
in <tt>lib/entry.S</tt>.
Now use <kbd>b *0x...</kbd> to set a breakpoint at the
<code>int&nbsp;$0x30</code> in <code>sys_cputs()</code> in <tt>hello</tt>
(see <tt>obj/user/hello.asm</tt> for the user-space address).
This <code>int</code> is the system call to display a character to
the console.
If you cannot execute as far as the <code>int</code>,
then something is wrong with your address space setup
or program loading code;
go back and fix it before continuing.
</p>

<h3 id="Handling-Interrupts-and-Exceptions">Handling Interrupts and Exceptions</h3>

<p>
At this point,
the first <code>int&nbsp;$0x30</code> system call instruction in user space
is a dead end:
once the processor gets into user mode,
there is no way to get back out.
You will now need to implement
basic exception and system call handling,
so that it is possible for the kernel to recover control of the processor
from user-mode code.
The first thing you should do
is thoroughly familiarize yourself with
the x86 interrupt and exception mechanism.

<p>
In this lab we generally follow Intel's terminology
for interrupts, exceptions, and the like.
However,
terms such as exception, trap, interrupt, fault and
abort have no standard meaning
across architectures or operating systems,
and are often used without regard to the subtle distinctions between them
on a particular architecture such as the x86.
When you see these terms outside of this lab,
the meanings might be slightly different.
</p>

<h3 id="Basics-of-Protected-Control-Transfer">Basics of Protected Control Transfer</h3>

<p>
Exceptions and interrupts are both
"protected control transfers,"
which cause the processor to switch from user to kernel mode
(CPL=0) without giving the user-mode code any opportunity
to interfere with the functioning of the kernel or other environments.
In Intel's terminology,
an <i>interrupt</i> is a protected control transfer
that is caused by an asynchronous event usually external to the processor,
such as notification of external device I/O activity.
An <i>exception</i>, in contrast,
is a protected control transfer
caused synchronously by the currently running code,
for example due to a divide by zero or an invalid memory access.
</p>

<p>
In order to ensure that these protected control transfers
are actually <i>protected</i>,
the processor's interrupt/exception mechanism is designed so that
the code currently running when the interrupt or exception occurs
<i>does not get to choose arbitrarily where the kernel is entered or how</i>.
Instead,
the processor ensures that the kernel can be entered
only under carefully controlled conditions.
On the x86, two mechanisms work together to provide this protection:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>	<b>The Interrupt Descriptor Table.</b>
	The processor ensures that interrupts and exceptions
	can only cause the kernel to be entered
	at a few specific, well-defined entry-points
	<i>determined by the kernel itself</i>,
	and not by the code running
	when the interrupt or exception is taken.
        </p>

	<p>
	The x86 allows up to 256 different
        interrupt or exception entry points into the kernel,
        each with a different <i>interrupt vector</i>.
        A vector is a number between 0 and 255.
        An interrupt's vector is determined by the
        source of the interrupt: different devices, error
        conditions, and application requests to the kernel
        generate interrupts with different vectors.
        The CPU uses the vector as an index
	into the processor's <i>interrupt descriptor table</i> (IDT),
	which the kernel sets up in kernel-private memory,
	much like the GDT.
	From the appropriate entry in this table
	the processor loads:
        </p>
	<ul>
	<li>	the value to load into
		the instruction pointer (<tt>EIP</tt>) register,
		pointing to the kernel code designated
		to handle that type of exception.</li>
	<li>	the value to load into
		the code segment (<tt>CS</tt>) register,
		which includes in bits 0-1 the privilege level
		at which the exception handler is to run.
		(In JOS, all exceptions are handled in kernel mode,
		privilege level 0.)</li>
	</ul>
        </li>

<li><p>	<b>The Task State Segment.</b>
	The processor needs a place
	to save the <i>old</i> processor state
	before the interrupt or exception occurred,
	such as the original values of <tt>EIP</tt> and <tt>CS</tt>
	before the processor invoked the exception handler,
	so that the exception handler can later restore that old state
	and resume the interrupted code from where it left off.
	But this save area for the old processor state
	must in turn be protected from unprivileged user-mode code;
	otherwise buggy or malicious user code
	could compromise the kernel.
	</p>

	<p>
	For this reason,
	when an x86 processor takes an interrupt or trap
	that causes a privilege level change from user to kernel mode,
        it also switches to a stack in the kernel's memory.
A structure called the <i>task state segment</i> (TSS) specifies
the segment selector and address where this stack lives.
	The processor pushes (on this new stack)
        <tt>SS</tt>, <tt>ESP</tt>, <tt>EFLAGS</tt>, <tt>CS</tt>, <tt>EIP</tt>, and an optional error code.
        Then it loads the <tt>CS</tt> and <tt>EIP</tt> from the interrupt descriptor,
and sets the <tt>ESP</tt> and <tt>SS</tt> to refer to the new stack.
	</p>

	<p>
	Although the TSS is large
	and can potentially serve a variety of purposes,
	JOS only uses it to define
	the kernel stack that the processor should switch to
	when it transfers from user to kernel mode.
	Since "kernel mode" in JOS
	is privilege level 0 on the x86,
	the processor uses the <tt>ESP0</tt> and <tt>SS0</tt> fields of the TSS
	to define the kernel stack when entering kernel mode.
        JOS doesn't use any other TSS fields.
	</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Types-of-Exceptions-and-Interrupts">Types of Exceptions and Interrupts</h3>

<p>
All of the synchronous exceptions
that the x86 processor can generate internally
use interrupt vectors between 0 and 31,
and therefore map to IDT entries 0-31.
For example,
a page fault always causes an exception through vector 14.
Interrupt vectors greater than 31 are only used by
<i>software interrupts</i>,
which can be generated by the <code>int</code> instruction, or
asynchronous <i>hardware interrupts</i>,
caused by external devices when they need attention.
</p>

<p>
In this section we will extend JOS to handle
the internally generated x86 exceptions in vectors 0-31.
In the next section we will make JOS handle
software interrupt vector 48 (0x30),
which JOS (fairly arbitrarily) uses as its system call interrupt vector.
In Lab 4 we will extend JOS to handle externally generated hardware interrupts
such as the clock interrupt.
</p>

<h3 id="An-Example">An Example</h3>

<p>
Let's put these pieces together and trace through an example.
Let's say the processor is executing code in a user environment
and encounters a divide instruction that attempts to divide by zero.
</p>

<ol>
<li>	The processor switches to the stack defined by the
	<tt>SS0</tt> and <tt>ESP0</tt> fields of the TSS,
	which in JOS will hold the values
	<code>GD_KD</code> and <code>KSTACKTOP</code>, respectively.</li>

<li>	The processor pushes the exception parameters on the
	kernel stack, starting at address <code>KSTACKTOP</code>:
	<pre>                     +--------------------+ KSTACKTOP             
                     | 0x00000 | old SS   |     " - 4
                     |      old ESP       |     " - 8
                     |     old EFLAGS     |     " - 12
                     | 0x00000 | old CS   |     " - 16
                     |      old EIP       |     " - 20 &lt;---- ESP 
                     +--------------------+             
	</pre></li>

<li>	Because we're handling a divide error,
	which is interrupt vector 0 on the x86,
	the processor reads IDT entry 0 and sets
	<tt>CS:EIP</tt> to point to the handler function described by
	the entry.</li>

<li>	The handler function takes control and handles the exception,
	for example by terminating the user environment.</li>
</ol>

<p>
For certain types of x86 exceptions,
in addition to the "standard" five words above,
the processor pushes onto the stack another word
containing an <i>error code</i>.
The page fault exception, number 14,
is an important example.
See the 80386 manual to determine for which exception numbers
the processor pushes an error code,
and what the error code means in that case.
When the processor pushes an error code,
the stack would look as follows at the beginning of the exception handler
when coming in from user mode:
</p>

	<pre>                     +--------------------+ KSTACKTOP             
                     | 0x00000 | old SS   |     " - 4
                     |      old ESP       |     " - 8
                     |     old EFLAGS     |     " - 12
                     | 0x00000 | old CS   |     " - 16
                     |      old EIP       |     " - 20
                     |     error code     |     " - 24 &lt;---- ESP
                     +--------------------+             
	</pre>

<h3 id="Nested-Exceptions-and-Interrupts">Nested Exceptions and Interrupts</h3>

<p>
The processor can take exceptions and interrupts
both from kernel and user mode.
It is only when entering the kernel from user mode, however,
that the x86 processor automatically switches stacks
before pushing its old register state onto the stack
and invoking the appropriate exception handler through the IDT.
If the processor is <i>already</i> in kernel mode
when the interrupt or exception occurs
(the low 2 bits of the <tt>CS</tt> register are already zero),
then the CPU just pushes more values on the same kernel stack.
In this way, the kernel can gracefully handle <i>nested exceptions</i>
caused by code within the kernel itself.
This capability is an important tool in implementing protection,
as we will see later in the section on system calls.
</p>

<p>
If the processor is already in kernel mode
and takes a nested exception,
since it does not need to switch stacks,
it does not save the old <tt>SS</tt> or <tt>ESP</tt> registers.
For exception types that do not push an error code,
the kernel stack therefore looks like the following
on entry to the exception handler:
</p>
<pre>                     +--------------------+ &lt;---- old ESP
                     |     old EFLAGS     |     " - 4
                     | 0x00000 | old CS   |     " - 8
                     |      old EIP       |     " - 12
                     +--------------------+             
</pre>

<p>
For exception types that push an error code,
the processor pushes the error code immediately after the old <tt>EIP</tt>,
as before.
</p>

<p>
There is one important caveat to the processor's nested exception capability.
If the processor takes an exception while already in kernel mode,
and <i>cannot push its old state onto the kernel stack</i> for any reason
such as lack of stack space,
then there is nothing the processor can do to recover,
so it simply resets itself.
Needless to say, the kernel should be designed so that this can't happen.
</p>

<h3 id="Setting-Up-the-IDT">Setting Up the IDT</h3>

<p>
You should now have the basic information you need
in order to set up the IDT and handle exceptions in JOS.
For now, you will set up the IDT to handle 
interrupt vectors 0-31 (the processor exceptions).
We'll handle system call interrupts later in this lab and add
interrupts 32-47 (the device IRQs) in a later lab.
</p>

<p>
The header files <tt>inc/trap.h</tt> and <tt>kern/trap.h</tt>
contain important definitions related to interrupts and exceptions
that you will need to become familiar with.
The file <tt>kern/trap.h</tt> contains definitions
that are strictly private to the kernel,
while <tt>inc/trap.h</tt>
contains definitions that may also be useful
to user-level programs and libraries.
</p>

<p>
Note:
Some of the exceptions in the range 0-31 are defined by Intel to be
reserved.
Since they will never be generated by the processor,
it doesn't really matter how you handle them.
Do whatever you think is cleanest.
</p>

<p>
The overall flow of control that you should achieve is depicted below: 
</p>

<pre>      IDT                   trapentry.S         trap.c
   
+----------------+                        
|   &amp;handler1    |---------&gt; handler1:          trap (struct Trapframe *tf)
|                |             // do stuff      {
|                |             call trap          // handle the exception/interrupt
|                |             // ...           }
+----------------+
|   &amp;handler2    |--------&gt; handler2:
|                |            // do stuff
|                |            call trap
|                |            // ...
+----------------+
       .
       .
       .
+----------------+
|   &amp;handlerX    |--------&gt; handlerX:
|                |             // do stuff
|                |             call trap
|                |             // ...
+----------------+
</pre>

<p>
Each exception or interrupt should have
its own handler in <tt>trapentry.S</tt>
and <code>trap_init()</code> should initialize the IDT with the addresses
of these handlers.
Each of the handlers should build a <code>struct Trapframe</code>
(see <tt>inc/trap.h</tt>) on the stack and call 
<code>trap()</code> (in <tt>trap.c</tt>)
with a pointer to the Trapframe.
<code>trap()</code> then handles the
exception/interrupt or dispatches to a specific
handler function.
</p>

<div class="required"><div id="Exercise-4" style="position: relative; top: -5em;"></div>

	<code>TRAPHANDLER</code> and <code>TRAPHANDLER_NOEC</code> in
	<tt>trapentry.S</tt> should help you, as well as the T_*

<p>
Now that your kernel has basic exception handling capabilities,
you will refine it to provide important operating system primitives
that depend on exception handling.
</p>

<h3 id="Handling-Page-Faults">Handling Page Faults</h3>

<p>
The page fault exception, interrupt vector 14 (<code>T_PGFLT</code>),
is a particularly important one that we will exercise heavily
throughout this lab and the next.
When the processor takes a page fault,
it stores the linear (i.e., virtual) address that caused the fault
in a special processor control register, <tt>CR2</tt>.
In <tt>trap.c</tt>
we have provided the beginnings of a special function,
<code>page_fault_handler()</code>,
to handle page fault exceptions.
</p>

<div class="required"><div id="Exercise-5" style="position: relative; top: -5em;"></div>
<p><span class="header">Exercise 5.</span>
	Modify <code>trap_dispatch()</code>
	to dispatch page fault exceptions
	to <code>page_fault_handler()</code>.
	You should now be able to get <kbd>make grade</kbd>
	to succeed on the <tt>faultread</tt>, <tt>faultreadkernel</tt>,
	<tt>faultwrite</tt>, and <tt>faultwritekernel</tt> tests.
	If any of them don't work, figure out why and fix them.
	Remember that you can boot JOS into a particular user program
	using <kbd>make run-<i>x</i></kbd> or <kbd>make run-<i>x</i>-nox</kbd>.
	For instance, <kbd>make run-hello-nox</kbd> runs the <i>hello</i> user
	program.
</p></div>

<p>
You will further refine the kernel's page fault handling below,
as you implement system calls.
</p>

<h3 id="The-Breakpoint-Exception">The Breakpoint Exception</h3>

<p>
The breakpoint exception, interrupt vector 3 (<code>T_BRKPT</code>),
is normally used to allow debuggers
to insert breakpoints in a program's code
by temporarily replacing the relevant program instruction
with the special 1-byte <code>int3</code> software interrupt instruction.
In JOS we will abuse this exception slightly
by turning it into a primitive pseudo-system call
that any user environment can use to invoke the JOS kernel monitor.
This usage is actually somewhat appropriate
if we think of the JOS kernel monitor as a primitive debugger.
The user-mode implementation of <code>panic()</code> in <tt>lib/panic.c</tt>,
for example,
performs an <code>int3</code> after displaying its panic message.
</p>

<div class="required"><div id="Exercise-6" style="position: relative; top: -5em;"></div>
<p><span class="header">Exercise 6.</span>
	Modify <code>trap_dispatch()</code>

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
	Modify the JOS kernel monitor so that
	you can 'continue' execution from the current location
	(e.g., after the <code>int3</code>,
	if the kernel monitor was invoked via the breakpoint exception),
	and so that you can single-step one instruction at a time.
	You will need to understand certain bits
	of the <tt>EFLAGS</tt> register
	in order to implement single-stepping.
	</p>

	<p><span class="header">Optional:</span>
	If you're feeling really adventurous,
	find some x86 disassembler source code -
	e.g., by ripping it out of QEMU,
	or out of GNU binutils, or just write it yourself -
	and extend the JOS kernel monitor
	to be able to disassemble and display instructions
	as you are stepping through them.
	Combined with the symbol table loading 
        from lab 1,
	this is the stuff of which real kernel debuggers are made.

<h3 id="System-calls">System calls</h3>

<p>
User processes ask the kernel to do things for them by
invoking system calls.  When the user process invokes a system call,
the processor enters kernel mode,
the processor and the kernel cooperate
to save the user process's state,
the kernel executes appropriate code in order to carry out the system
call, and then resumes the user process.  The exact
details of how the user process gets the kernel's attention
and how it specifies which call it wants to execute vary
from system to system.
</p>

<p>
In the JOS kernel, we will use the <code>int</code>
instruction, which causes a processor interrupt.
In particular, we will use <code>int&nbsp;$0x30</code>
as the system call interrupt.
We have defined the constant
<code>T_SYSCALL</code> to 48 (0x30) for you.  You will have to
set up the interrupt descriptor to allow user processes to
cause that interrupt.  Note that interrupt 0x30 cannot be
generated by hardware, so there is no ambiguity caused by
allowing user code to generate it.
</p>

<p>
The application will pass the system call number and
the system call arguments in registers.  This way, the kernel won't
need to grub around in the user environment's stack
or instruction stream.  The
system call number will go in <code>%eax</code>, and the
arguments (up to five of them) will go in <code>%edx</code>,
<code>%ecx</code>, <code>%ebx</code>, <code>%edi</code>,
and <code>%esi</code>, respectively.  The kernel passes the
return value back in <code>%eax</code>.  The assembly code to
invoke a system call has been written for you, in
<code>syscall()</code> in <tt>lib/syscall.c</tt>.  You
should read through it and make sure you understand what
is going on.
</p>

<div class="required"><div id="Exercise-7" style="position: relative; top: -5em;"></div>
<p><span class="header">Exercise 7.</span>
	Add a handler in the kernel
	for interrupt vector <code>T_SYSCALL</code>.
	You will have to edit <tt>kern/trapentry.S</tt> and
	<tt>kern/trap.c</tt>'s <code>trap_init()</code>.  You
	also need to change <code>trap_dispatch()</code> to handle the
	system call interrupt by calling <code>syscall()</code>
	(defined in <tt>kern/syscall.c</tt>)
	with the appropriate arguments,
	and then arranging for
	the return value to be passed back to the user process
	in <code>%eax</code>.
	Finally, you need to implement <code>syscall()</code> in
	<tt>kern/syscall.c</tt>.
	Make sure <code>syscall()</code> returns <code>-E_INVAL</code>
	if the system call number is invalid.
	You should read and understand <tt>lib/syscall.c</tt>
	(especially the inline assembly routine) in order to confirm
	your understanding of the system call interface.
	Handle all the system calls listed in <tt>inc/syscall.h</tt> by
        invoking the corresponding kernel function for each call.
	</p>

	<p>
	Run the <tt>user/hello</tt> program under your kernel
	(<kbd>make run-hello</kbd>).
	It should print "<tt>hello, world</tt>" on the console
	and then cause a page fault in user mode.
	If this does not happen, it probably means
	your system call handler isn't quite right.
	You should also now be able to get <kbd>make grade</kbd>
	to succeed on the <tt>testbss</tt> test.

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
	Implement system calls using the <code>sysenter</code> and
	<code>sysexit</code> instructions instead of using
	<code>int&nbsp;0x30</code> and <code>iret</code>. 
	</p>

	<p>
	The <code>sysenter/sysexit</code> instructions were designed
	by Intel to be faster than <code>int/iret</code>.  They do
	this by using registers instead of the stack and by making
	assumptions about how the segmentation registers are used.
	The exact details of these instructions can be found in Volume
	2B of the Intel reference manuals.
	</p>

	<p>
	The easiest way to add support for these instructions in JOS
	is to add a <code>sysenter_handler</code> in
	<tt>kern/trapentry.S</tt> that saves enough information about
	the user environment to return to it, sets up the kernel
	environment, pushes the arguments to
	<code>syscall()</code> and calls <code>syscall()</code>
	directly.  Once <code>syscall()</code> returns, set everything
	up for and execute the <code>sysexit</code> instruction.
	You will also need to add code to <tt>kern/init.c</tt> to
	set up the necessary model specific registers (MSRs).  Section
	6.1.2 in Volume 2 of the AMD Architecture Programmer's Manual
	and the reference on SYSENTER in Volume 2B of the Intel
	reference manuals give good descriptions of the relevant MSRs.
	You can find an implementation of <code>wrmsr</code> to add to
	<tt>inc/x86.h</tt> for writing to these MSRs <a href="http://ftp.kh.edu.tw/Linux/SuSE/people/garloff/linux/k6mod.c">here</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	Finally, <tt>lib/syscall.c</tt> must be changed to support
	making a system call with <code>sysenter</code>.  Here is a
	possible register layout for the <code>sysenter</code>
	instruction:
	</p>

	<pre>	eax                - syscall number
	edx, ecx, ebx, edi - arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4
	esi                - return pc
	ebp                - return esp
	esp                - trashed by sysenter
	</pre>

	<p>
	GCC's inline assembler will automatically save registers that
	you tell it to load values directly into.  Don't forget to
	either save (push) and restore (pop) other registers that you
	clobber, or tell the inline assembler that you're clobbering
	them.  The inline assembler doesn't support saving
	<code>%ebp</code>, so you will need to add code to save and
	restore it yourself.  The return
	address can be put into <code>%esi</code> by using an
	instruction like <code>leal after_sysenter_label,
	%%esi</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
	Note that this only supports 4 arguments, so you will need to
	leave the old method of doing system calls around
	to support 5 argument system calls.  Furthermore, because this
	fast path doesn't update the current environment's trap frame,
	it won't be suitable for some of the system calls we add in
	later labs.
	</p>

	<p>
	You may have to revisit your code once we enable asynchronous
	interrupts in the next lab.  Specifically, you'll need to
	enable interrupts when returning to the user process, which
	<code>sysexit</code> doesn't do for you.
	</p>

<h3 id="User-mode-startup">User-mode startup</h3>

<p>
A user program starts running at the top of
<tt>lib/entry.S</tt>.  After some setup, this code
calls <code>libmain()</code>, in <tt>lib/libmain.c</tt>.
You should modify <tt>libmain()</tt> to initialize the global pointer
<code>thisenv</code> to point at this environment's
<code>struct Env</code> in the <code>envs[]</code> array.
(Note that <tt>lib/entry.S</tt> has already defined <code>envs</code>
to point at the <code>UENVS</code> mapping you set up in Part A.)
Hint: look in <tt>inc/env.h</tt> and use
<code>sys_getenvid</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>libmain()</code> then calls <code>umain</code>, which,
in the case of the hello program, is in
<tt>user/hello.c</tt>.  Note that after printing
"<tt>hello, world</tt>", it tries to access
<code>thisenv-&gt;env_id</code>.  This is why it faulted earlier.
Now that you've initialized <code>thisenv</code> properly,
it should not fault.
If it still faults, you probably haven't mapped the
<code>UENVS</code> area user-readable (back in Part A in
<tt>pmap.c</tt>; this is the first time we've actually
used the <code>UENVS</code> area).
</p>

<div class="required"><div id="Exercise-8" style="position: relative; top: -5em;"></div>
<p><span class="header">Exercise 8.</span>
	Add the required code to the user library, then 
	boot your kernel.  You should see <tt>user/hello</tt>
	print "<tt>hello, world</tt>" and then print "<tt>i
	am environment 00001000</tt>".
	<tt>user/hello</tt> then attempts to "exit"
	by calling <code>sys_env_destroy()</code>
	(see <tt>lib/libmain.c</tt> and <tt>lib/exit.c</tt>).
	Since the kernel currently only supports one user environment,
	it should report that it has destroyed the only environment
	and then drop into the kernel monitor.
	You should be able to get <kbd>make grade</kbd>
	to succeed on the <tt>hello</tt> test.

<h3 id="Page-faults-and-memory-protection">Page faults and memory protection</h3>

<p>
Memory protection is a crucial feature of an operating system,
ensuring that
bugs in one program cannot corrupt other programs or corrupt the operating
system itself.
</p>

<p>
Operating systems usually rely on hardware support
to implement memory protection. 
The OS keeps the hardware informed about which virtual addresses
are valid and which are not.  When a program tries to access an invalid
address or one for which it has no permissions, the processor stops the
program at the instruction causing the fault and then traps
into the kernel with information about the attempted operation.
If the fault is fixable, the kernel can fix it and let the program 
continue running.  If the fault is not fixable, then the program cannot
continue, since it will never get past the instruction causing the fault.
</p>

<p>
As an example of a fixable fault, consider an automatically extended stack.
In many systems the kernel initially allocates a single stack page, and then
if a program faults accessing pages further down the stack, the kernel
will allocate those pages automatically and let the program continue.
By doing this, the kernel only allocates as much stack memory as
the program needs, but the program can work under the illusion that it
has an arbitrarily large stack.
</p>

<p>
System calls present an interesting problem for memory protection.
Most system call interfaces let user programs pass pointers to the 
kernel.  These pointers point at user buffers to be read or written.
The kernel then dereferences these pointers
while carrying out the system call.
There are two problems with this:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
	A page fault in the kernel
	is potentially a lot more serious than a page fault in a user program.
	If the kernel page-faults while manipulating its own data structures,
        that's a kernel bug, and the
	fault handler should panic the kernel
	(and hence the whole system).
	But when the kernel is dereferencing pointers
        given to it by the user program,
	it needs a way to remember that any page faults these dereferences cause
	are actually on behalf of the user program.
</li>

<li>
	The kernel typically has more memory permissions than the user program.
	The user program might pass a pointer to a system call that points
        to memory that the kernel can read or write but that the program
        cannot.
        The kernel must be careful not to be tricked into dereferencing
        such a pointer, since that might reveal private information or
	destroy the integrity of the kernel.
</li>
</ol>

<!-- 
This danger is one instance of a classic security problem
known as the "confused deputy" problem.
The kernel is acting as a trusted "deputy",
which has the special privileges necessary
to implement important services needed by untrusted users -
but if users can confuse the kernel into using those special privileges
in unintended ways, the security model breaks down.

            (<i>Challenge</i>!!! Explore the literature
		on the confused deputy problem
		available on the Internet,
		and identify other aspects of the design of this toy kernel
		and existing well-known operating systems
		in which this security risk may occur.)
            <p>
-->

<p>
For both of these reasons the kernel must be extremely careful when 
handling pointers presented by user programs.
</p>

<p>
You will now solve these two problems with 
a single mechanism that scrutinizes
all pointers passed from userspace into the kernel.
When a program passes the kernel a pointer, the kernel will check
that the address is in the user part of the address space,
and that the page table would allow the memory operation.
</p>

<p>
Thus, the kernel will never suffer a page fault due to dereferencing
a user-supplied pointer.
If the kernel does page fault, it should panic and terminate.
</p>

<div class="required"><div id="Exercise-9" style="position: relative; top: -5em;"></div>

	</p>

	<p>Read <code>user_mem_assert</code> in <tt>kern/pmap.c</tt>
  	and implement <code>user_mem_check</code> in that same file.
	</p>

	<p>

	</p>

	<p>
	Boot your kernel, running <tt>user/buggyhello</tt>.

	[00001000] free env 00001000
	Destroyed the only environment - nothing more to do!

	<p>
	Finally, change <code>debuginfo_eip</code> in

	<code>usd</code>, <code>stabs</code>, and
	<code>stabstr</code>.  If you now run

	You don't need to fix it, but you should understand why it
	happens.
