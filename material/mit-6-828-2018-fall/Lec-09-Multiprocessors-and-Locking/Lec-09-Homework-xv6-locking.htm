<h1>Homework: xv6 locking</h1>

<p>In this assignment you will explore some of the interaction between interrupts
and locking. Submit your solutions before the beginning of the next lecture to
the <a href="https://6828.scripts.mit.edu/2018/handin.py/">submission web site</a>.

</p><h2>Don't do this</h2>
<p>
Make sure you understand what would happen if the xv6 kernel executed
the following code snippet:
</p>
<pre>  struct spinlock lk;
  initlock(&amp;lk, "test lock");
  acquire(&amp;lk);
  acquire(&amp;lk);
</pre>
(Feel free to use QEMU to find out.  <code>acquire</code> is in <code>spinlock.c</code>.)

<div class="question">
<p><b>Submit</b>: Explain in one sentence what happens.
</p></div>

<h2>Interrupts in ide.c</h2>

<p>
An <code>acquire</code> ensures that interrupts are off
on the local processor using the <code>cli</code> instruction
(via <code>pushcli()</code>),
and that interrupts remain off until the <code>release</code>
of the last lock held by that processor
(at which point they are enabled using <code>sti</code>).
</p>

<p>
Let's see what happens if we turn on interrupts while
holding the <code>ide</code> lock.
In <code>iderw</code> in <code>ide.c</code>, add a call
to <code>sti()</code> after the <code>acquire()</code>,
and a call to <code>cli()</code> just before the <code>release()</code>.
Rebuild the kernel and boot it in QEMU.
Chances are the kernel will panic soon after boot; try booting QEMU a few times
if it doesn't.
</p>

<div class="question">
<p><b>Submit</b>: Explain in a few sentences why the kernel panicked.
You may find it useful to look up the stack trace
(the sequence of <code>%eip</code> values printed by <code>panic</code>)
in the <code>kernel.asm</code> listing.</p>
</div>

<h2>Interrupts in file.c</h2>

Remove the <code>sti()</code> and <code>cli()</code> you added,
rebuild the kernel, and make sure it works again.

<p>
Now let's see what happens if we turn on interrupts
while holding the <code>file_table_lock</code>.
This lock  protects the table of file descriptors,
which the kernel modifies when an application opens or closes
a file.
In <code>filealloc()</code> in <code>file.c</code>, add
a call to
<code>sti()</code> after the call to <code>acquire()</code>,
and a <code>cli()</code> just before <b>each</b> of the
<code>release()</code>es.
You will also need to add 
<code>#include "x86.h"</code> at the top of the file after
the other <code>#include</code> lines.
Rebuild the kernel and boot it in QEMU.
It most likely will not panic.
</p>

<div class="question">
<p><b>Submit</b>: Explain in a few sentences why the kernel didn't panic.
Why do <code>file_table_lock</code> and <code>ide_lock</code> have
different behavior in this respect?</p>
<p>
You do not need to understand anything about the details of the IDE hardware
to answer this question, but you may find it helpful to look 
at which functions acquire each lock, and then at when those
functions get called.
</p>
</div>

(On qemu there is a small chance that the kernel will panic
with the extra <code>sti()</code> in <code>filealloc()</code>.
If the kernel <i>does</i> panic, make doubly sure that
you removed the <code>sti()</code> call from 
<code>iderw</code>.  If it continues to panic and the
only extra <code>sti()</code> is in <code>filealloc()</code>,
then think about why this should be unlikely on real hardware.
If you are running on real hardware, then
mail <i>6.828-staff@pdos.csail.mit.edu</i>
and think about buying a lottery ticket.)

<h2>xv6 lock implementation</h2>

<div class="question">
<p><b>Submit</b>: Why does <code>release()</code> clear
<code>lk-&gt;pcs[0]</code> and <code>lk-&gt;cpu</code>
<i>before</i> clearing <code>lk-&gt;locked</code>?
Why not wait until after?</p>
</div>
