# sequence coordination:
  threads need to wait for specific events or conditions:
    wait for disk read to complete
    wait for pipe reader(s) to make space in pipe
    wait for any child to exit

# why not just have a while-loop that spins until event happens?

# better solution: coordination primitives that yield the CPU
  sleep & wakeup (xv6)
  condition variables (homework)
  barriers (homework)
  etc.

# sleep & wakeup:
  sleep(chan, lock)
    sleeps on a "channel", an address to name the condition we are sleeping on
  wakeup(chan)
    wakeup wakes up all threads sleeping on chan
    may wake up more than one thread
  no formal connection to the condition the sleeper is waiting for
    and indeed sleep() can return even if condition isn't true
    so caller must treat sleep() return as a hint

# two problems arise in design of sleep/wakeup
  - lost wakeup
  - termination while sleeping

# example use of sleep/wakeup -- iderw() / ideintr()
  iderw() queues block read request, then sleep()s
    b is a buffer which will be filled with the block content
    iderw() sleeps waiting for B_VALID -- the disk read to complete
    chan is b -- this buffer (there may be other processes in iderw())
  ideintr() is called via interrupt when current disk read is done
    marks b B_VALID
    wakeup(b) -- same chan as sleep

puzzles
  iderw() holds idelock when it calls sleep
  but ideintr() needs to acquire idelock!
  why doesn't iderw() release idelock before calling sleep()?
  let's try it!

# lost wakeup demo
  modify iderw() to call release ; broken_sleep ; acquire
  look at broken_sleep()
  look at wakeup()
  what happens?
  ideintr() runs after iderw() saw no B_VALID
    but before broken_sleep() sets state = SLEEPING
    wakeup() scans proctable but no thread is SLEEPING
  then sleep() sets current thread to SLEEPING and yields
  sleep misses wakeup -> deadlock
  this is a "lost wakeup"

# xv6 lost wakeup solution:
  goal: 
    1) lock out wakeup() for entire time between condition
       check and state = SLEEPING
    2) release the condition lock while asleep
  xv6 strategy:
    require wakeup() to hold both lock on condition AND ptable.lock
    sleeper at all times holds one or the other lock
      can release condition lock after it holds ptable.lock
  look at ideintr()'s call to wakeup()
    and wakeup itself
    both locks are held while looking for sleepers
  look at iderw()'s call to sleep()
    condition lock is held when it calls sleep()
    look at sleep() -- acquires ptable.lock, then releases lock on condition
  diagram:
    |----idelock----|
                  |---ptable.lock---|
                                     |----idelock----|
                                      |-ptable.lock-|
  thus:
    either complete sleep() sequence runs, then wakeup(),
      and the sleeper will be woken up
    or wakeup() runs first, before potential sleeper checks condition,
      but waker will have set condition true
  requires that sleep() takes a lock argument

# People have developed many sequence coordination primitives,
  all of which have to solve the lost wakeup problem.
  e.g. condition variables (similar to sleep/wakeup)
  e.g. counting semaphores
  e.g. wait queues (linux kernel)

# Another example: piperead()
  the while loop is waiting for more than zero bytes of data in buffer
    wakeup is at end of pipewrite()
    chan is &p->nread
  what is the race if piperead() used broken_sleep()?
  why is there a loop around the sleep()?
  why the wakeup() at the end of piperead()?

# second sequence coordination challenge -- how to terminate a sleeping thread?

# first, how does kill(target_pid) work?
  problem: may not be safe to forcibly terminate a process
    it might be executing in the kernel
      using its kernel stack, page table, proc[] entry
    might be in a critical section, needs to finish to restore invariants
    so we can't immediately terminate it
  solution: target exits at next convenient point
    kill() sets p->killed flag 
    target thread checks p->killed in trap() and exit()s
      so kill() doesn't disturb e.g. critical sections
    exit() closes FDs, sets state=ZOMBIE, yields CPU
      why can't it free kernel stack and page table?
    parent wait() frees kernel stack, page table, and proc[] slot

# what if kill() target is sleep()ing?
  e.g. waiting for console input, or in wait(), or iderw()
  we'd like target to stop sleeping and exit()
  but that's not always reasonable
    maybe target is sleep()ing halfway through a complex operation
      that (for consistency) must complete
    e.g. creating a file

# xv6 solution
  see kill() in proc.c
    changes SLEEPING to RUNNABLE -- like wakeup()
  some sleep loops check for p->killed
    e.g. piperead()
    sleep() will return due to kill's state=RUNNABLE
    in a loop, so re-checks
      condition true -> reads some bytes, then trap ret calls exit()
      condition false -> sees p->killed, return, trap ret calls exit()
    either way, near-instant response to kill() of thread in piperead()
  some sleep loops don't check p->killed
    Q: why not modify iderw() to check p->killed in sleep loop and return?
    A: if reading, calling FS code expects to see data in the disk buffer!
       if writing (or reading), might be halfway through create()
       quitting now leaves on-disk FS inconsistent.
  so a thread in iderw() may continue executing for a while in the kernel
    trap() will exit() after the system call finishes

# xv6 spec for kill
  if target is in user space
    will die next time it makes a system call or takes a timer interrupt
  if target is in the kernel
    target will never execute another a user instruction
    but may spend quite a while yet in the kernel

# how does JOS cope with these problems?
  lost wakeups?
    JOS interrupts are disabled in the kernel
    so wakeup can't sneak between condition check and sleep
  termination while blocking?
    JOS has only a few system calls, and they are fairly simple
      no blocking multi-step operations like create()
      since no FS and no disk driver in the kernel
    really only one blocking call -- IPC recv()
      if env_destroy() is running, the target thread is not running
      recv() leaves env in a state where it can be safely destroyed

# Summary
  sleep/wakeup let threads wait for specific events
  concurrency and interrupts mean we have to worry about lost wakeups
  termination is a pain in threading systems
    context switch vs process exit
    sleeping vs kill
